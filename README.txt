This folder contains a matlab code titled “Calc_Density_Hydration.m”.
This code uses our thermal modeling results and perple_x results to calculate slab density, density across our A-A’ transect (figure 1 in our manuscript), and wt% H2O across transect and contained within the slab. A further description is contained within the matlab code itself.

This code uses files in three folders in order to run properly. It uses the files in the “Data” folder, which contains the results for Alaskan flat-slab subduction thermal conditions from two different thermal modeling codes. Results using PGCTherm2D are in the file titled “pgc_shear03_03252020.dat”. Results using Thermod8 are in the file titled “thermod_shear03_03252020.txt”. The final file in the “Data” folder is “geometry3.txt”, which defines the geometry of the subduction zone for the Calc_Density_Hydration.m code.
The matlab functions contained within the “Functions” folder allow the matlab code to read Perple_X .tab files, as well as various other codes that enable the Calc_Density_Hydration.m code to work.

Within the Perple_X_Files folder are all the .tab files required for the Calc_Density_Hydration.m code to function properly, as well as other Perple_X related data from our research. Within the main folder are results run in Perple_X using werami for each of the compositions used in our study. They include.tab files created within Perple_X werami for density on a 100 by 100 2D grid and H2O (wt%) on a 100 by 100 2D grid.

Within the anhydrous_assemblages_figures folder, we present the anhydrous results as .eps files for both of the basalt compositions used in our study, the gabbro used in our study, and the peridotite composition used in our study. The MORB composition anhydrous results are presented inthe figure basalt_0_h2o_allmorb_modes_hp11ver_1109_2.eps, the Yakutat basalt composition anhydrous results are presented in the figure basalt_0_h2o_yak_modes_hp11ver_1109_2.eps, the gabbro composition anhydrous results are presented in the figure gabbro_0_h2o_modes_hp11ver_1111.eps, and the MOR periditite composition anhydrous results are presented in the figure perid_DMM_0h2o_hp11ver_1028_thermod.eps.
All results are plotted along the 0-850 km transect A-A’ (from figure 1 of our manuscript), and are plotted using results from Thermod8. The PT conditions used to plot these figures are synonymous with the PT conditions shown in our supplementary materials Figure S9.

Within the perple_X_dat_files folder are the .dat Perple_x files used to create all our results, and include the saturated and anhydrous .dat files for each composition. We also include our perplex_option.dat file, our solution_model.dat file, and the hp11ver.dat files that was modified using ctransf (ctransf_hp11ver.dat).

From the main directory, the pgctherm2d_files folder contains the input_data and inst_cb inst_ob files used to run the finite element thermal modeling in Alaska. This folder includes folder for both the no shear heating included model and shear heating included (frictional coefficient of 0.03). The input_data files defines the geometry and parameters for the finite element thermal model, and the inst_cb and inst_ob files define the continental and oceanic side geotherms respectively. The .dat files in each folder contain the results.

From the main directory, the thermod_files folder contains the .sf files used within the Thermod8 software for our finite difference Alaska thermal modeling. The file titled “AK MODEL MARCH 4 2020 2KM FRICCRNFLW FC_0.03 to 100 my.sf” contains the run parameters for our 2-km spaced model of Alaska and includes frictional heating. It has been run out to 100 my. The file “AK MODEL MARCH 4 2020 2KM NOFRICCRNFLW .sf” contains the run parameters for our 2-km spaced model of Alaska with no frictional heating included. Either of these files may be uploaded into the Thermod8 software to view run parameters.
